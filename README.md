# Climb On

Climb on is an app for tracking climbing training sessions. **This app is not currently being worked on. I may continue with it again. In the meantime, I've written up a summary of the project under the "postmortem section.**

## Postmortem
After taking a break from this project I no longer was interested in continuing. However, it was a fun learning experience and I like to document what went well, why I stopped, what didn't go well, and what I'm going to take into the next project.

### What went well
I made an iOS app and got it to the point where it was in closed beta at my climbing gym. It was awesome to see people around me using my app and giving me feedback on it. In addition, I had never used React Native before so it was fantastic to get so far on my first project in a new technology.

The code was clean and I made regular progression. At the time I was working on this I was also reading *Code Complete* and it was very fulfilling to apply what I was reading to a project so I could burn the lessons into my mind. Specifically, the mantra "reduce complexity" was deeply engrained in my thought process as I was building this out. Ultimately this lead to a very nice progression of the app.

### Why I stopped
I started a mew job at the beginning of June 2019 (you might notice the last commit was May 29th). I wanted to fully dedicate myself to getting up to speed on the new team and adjust to living in a new city, so I had a lot of other things in my life that were higher priority than this personal project. Also, as I'll discuss in the next section, I think the problem being solved -- climbing skill not progressing -- by this app shifted slightly.
